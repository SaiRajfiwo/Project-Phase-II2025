The ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) Management System is a web-based solution designed to streamline and automate the core administrative, financial, and operational tasks of IT companies and training institutes. Built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, the system provides a centralized platform where different stakeholders—Admins, Project Managers, Developers, and Clients—can interact through role-specific dashboards. The application facilitates real-time project tracking, employee task management, client interaction, financial monitoring, and feedback collection, all within a secure and scalable environment.

The system architecture emphasizes modularity and role-based access control to ensure that each user accesses only the functionalities relevant to their responsibilities. Admins can manage branches, users, tasks, and expenses; Project Managers handle developer assignments, project timelines, and client sessions; Developers update task status, track sessions, and view salaries; Clients can check project progress, submit requirements, book sessions, and provide feedback. Additional features such as attendance tracking, salary automation, referral system, and performance analytics make the system comprehensive and future-ready.

Overall, the ERP Management System not only replaces the need for multiple disconnected tools and manual record-keeping but also empowers organizations to operate more transparently and efficiently. It enhances productivity, reduces communication gaps, and offers a digital backbone that supports business scalability, making it an ideal solution for modern IT-based businesses seeking streamlined management.
